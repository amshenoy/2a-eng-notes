# Probability Estimation

## Tail Probabilities
Markov and Chebyshev inequalities are ways to bound tail
probabilities with limited information about the random variable.
* **Markov** is for **non-negative** rvs and requires only $ mean (\mu) $ 
* **Chebyshev** is for **general** rvs, and requires $ mean (\mu) $ and $ variance (\sigma^{2}) $
