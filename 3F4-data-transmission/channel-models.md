# Channel Models

**General LTI Noise Model**
$$ y(t) = h(t) * x(t) + n(t) $$

**AWGN**
$$ y(t) = x(t) + n(t) $$

We can use AWGN as a simplification when delay is constant and power spectrum is constant in magnitude.

**Baseband**
Telephone - AWGN
DSL - General

**Passband**

Geostationary - AWGN
Mobile Wireless - General
