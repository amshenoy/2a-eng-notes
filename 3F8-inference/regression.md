$ X $ could be considered to be a diagonal matrix containing set of functions $\{\phi_{i}(\underline{x})\}$
$$ \underline{y} = \[\phi_{i}(\underline{x}) \]^{T} \underline{w} + \underline{e} $$

# Note: We generally consider $ \underline{e} $ to be gaussian for ease of solving but this is an assumption of our scenario.
