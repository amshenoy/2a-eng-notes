# Queuing Theory

## CTMCs Birth-Death Processes


## Kendall's Notation

U/V/s/κ/W


U and V denote the inter-arrival and service time distributions. The most important
abbreviations are D for deterministic (i.e., not probabilistic), M for memoryless (i.e.,
exponential) and G for general (i.e., unspecified) distribution.
• s is the number of servers
• κ is the system capacity; that is, the maximum number of customers in the system (the
queue and the servers).
• W is the queueing protocol or discipline. Common examples are FIFO (First In First
Out), LIFO (Last In First Out) and priority-based.
Note that κ and W are optional with default values κ = ∞ and W = FIFO.
