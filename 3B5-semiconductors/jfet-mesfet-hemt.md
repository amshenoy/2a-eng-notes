# JFET, MESFET & HEMT

FETs are **unipolar** devices ie. current flow dominated by drift current.

## JFET

**Use of PN Junction**



### Pinch-Off Voltage





### Current-Voltage Characteristics

## MESFET 

**Use of MS Junction** (More specifically a **reverse-biased Schottky barrier**)





### HEMT

High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) is a variant on the MESFET

To increase conductivity of a MESFET, we could increase the doping level, but the increased number of impurity atoms causes more electron scattering and reduces mobility.
Therefore, we use a wide bandgap doped semiconductor with a thin, low doped semiconductor to form a heterojunction with an accumulation of electrons in the thin layer.
