# Personality

**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** 

* Invalid categorization of personality types - Marginal Examples
* Not based on scientific findings
* MBTI does not predict organisational outcomes

**5 Five Factor Model (FFM)**
OCEAN for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neurototicism (Emotional Stability)

* Does not force personality into certain categories
* Based on scientific findings
* Significantly predicting organizational outcomes

Personality based on:
* Heredity is the most dominant factor
* Environmental factors do have some influence
* Aging influences levels of ability

# Culture



### Optional

### Origins of Culture

#### 1) Cultural-Transfer Perspective
Leader's Past Experience

#### 2) Leader Perspective
Leader's Personality
Negative effect due to bounded rationality and availability bias

#### 3) Functionality Perspective
Cultures are created because those cultures are beneficial to groups

#### Characteristics
Shared Beliefs
Implicit Control
Artifacts: Empirical Evidence

</br>

## Socialisation

### Prearrival
Information of organisation

### Encounter
Integration with organisation

Language: To communicate assumptions, values
• Symbols: To reinforce values and ideology
• Stories/Myths: Exemplifying norms and heroes
• Ceremonies/rituals: To build cohesion and morale
• Dress/uniform: To reinforce identity
• Technology/Structure/Physical Environment: To
reinforce values and shape communication patterns

### Metamorphosis
Adaptation of thought and behaviour of new leader to new organisation

</br>

## Reverse Causality
Idea that people select cultures
* Person-Organisation Fit
* Attraction-Selection-Attrition Theory

</br><hr>

# Perception
Perception is a process by which individuals interpret and organize their sensory impressions to give meaning to their environment.

**Bounded Rationality Theory**
Cognitive capacity is limited
Limited availability of information
Cognitive biases

</br><hr>

# Motivation

$$ \text{Performance} = f(\text{Ability}, \text{Motivation}) $$

$$ \text{Motivation} = f(\underbrace{\text{Effort}}_{\text{Velocity}}, \ \underbrace{\text{Persistence}}_{\text{Duration}}, \underbrace{\text{Goal}}_{\text{Distance Required}}) $$

</br>

## Content-Based Theories
Method of profiling or analysing individuals’ needs that motivate their behavior 

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

**Pyramid**
* Self-actualization: acheiving full-potential
* Esteem needs: self-respect, recognition
* Social needs: needs for having social relationships with others
* Safety needs: security and protection from physical, emotional harms
* Physiological needs: hunger, thirst, shelter, other bodily needs

(+) Intuitive </br>
(-) Not always true </br>

### McClelland’s Theory of Needs

Maslow's Theory (with first three labelle as **Achievement**, **Power**, **Affiliation**) but no heirarchy

</br>

##### Alternative: ERG Theory - Existence - Relatedness - Growth &emsp; (Dual Cycle)


</br>

## Process-Based Theories
Cognitive processes influencing motivation

### Expectancy theory

$$ \text{Motivation} = f(\text{Expectancy}, \text{Instrumentality}, \text{Valence}) $$

**Expectancy** - Effort to Performance Conversion - (Ability, Definition, Trust)

**Instrumentality** - Performance to Reward Conversion - (Trust, Understanding, Fair Allocation)

**Valence** - Reward to Goals Conversion


(-) Performance not always measurable </br>
(-) Model success dependent on valence </br>


</br>

##### Alternative: Equity theory
</br>

## Contemporary Theories

### Self-Determination theory

**Intrinsic** > **Extrinsic** Motivation

* People prefer to have self-determination therefore being more likely to enjoy their jobs (intrinsic motivation)
* Intrinsic motivation has stronger effects on performance

* Monetary incentives undermine the sense of self-determination as you feel that the cause of your actions come from external sources 
* Monetary incentives lower your sense of self-determination, therefore your intrinsic motivation, and thereby your performance.

</br>

##### Alternative: Goal-Setting theory

# Creativity, Innovation, and Innovation Diffusion


### Mandatory Reading: [Productivity Loss in Brainstorm Groups](https://ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pdh&AN=1988-01348-001&site=ehost-live&scope=site)

### Mandatory Reading: [Model of Creativity](http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Amabile_A_Model_of_CreativityOrg.Beh_v10_pp123-167.pdf)

### Mandatory Reading: [Creativity as Flexibility and Persistence](https://doi.org/10.1080/10463281003765323)




## Creativity
Generation of novel and useful ideas

Overlap of **Intrinsic Motivation**, **Creative Skills**, **Expertise**.


### Dual-Pathway to Creativity Model

* **Cognitive Flexibility**
Use of broad and inclusive cognitive categories through flexible switching among categories and use of remote associations between different cognitive categories

* **Cognitive Persistence**:
The systematic, effortful, and in-depth exploration of only a few cognitive categories


</br>

## Innovation

Process:
1) Generation
2) Evaluation
3) Selection
4) Implementation


</br>

## Innovation Diffusion

Process:
1) Recognition / Evaluation of Innovation
2) Adoption of Innovation
3) Implementation


### Adopter’s Dilemma

__Not Adopt__
- Losing Competitive Advantage

__Adopt__
- Ambiguity
- Cost
- Inerita of Success

# Group Dynamics

### Mandatory Reference this [Experiential Effect Group Dynamics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/256567.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A7e3de1253822525392bcf67773f7cdc9) as (Schweiger & Sandberg 20)
> Decisions efficacy: Dialectical Inquiry = Devil's Advocacy > Consensus
> Positive reaction: Consensus > Devil's Advocacy > Dialectical Inquiry


### Decision-making in groups
(+) More complete information and knowledge
(+) Increased diversity of views
(+) Increased acceptance of better solutions
(+) Diffusion of responsibility

(-) Time-consuming (slow)
(-) Conformity pressures (→ groupthink)
(-) Domination by small numbers
(-) Diffusion of Responsibility (→ social loafing)

</br>

### Groupthink
Group pressures for conformity deter the group from critically evaluating unusual, minority, or unpopular opinions.

- People don;t want to dissent
- Cultural influence
- Individualistic cultures less conform
- Dominant (i.e., self-assured and assertive) group members tend to yield the most influence in groups
- People (group members, the research team, external observers) rate dominant individuals as more competent—even when they actually lack competence!

#### Solutions
Dissent must be valued
Group members must feel comfortable speaking up
Use “devil’s advocate” role
Bring in outsiders
Anonymous evaluations of ideas

</br>

### Social loafing
Tendency to withhold physical or intellectual effort when performing a group task.

- Main cause: diffusion of responsibility
- More pronounced in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures.

#### Solution: Make individual performance visible!
