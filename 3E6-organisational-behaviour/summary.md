Note*: This module is purely conjectural and mostly based on opinion so for exam purposes, just take it for granted. Hence also written as a summary.

# Personality

**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** 

* Invalid categorization of personality types - Marginal Examples
* Not based on scientific findings
* MBTI does not predict organisational outcomes

**5 Five Factor Model (FFM)**
OCEAN for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neurototicism (Emotional Stability)

* Does not force personality into certain categories
* Based on scientific findings
* Significantly predicting organizational outcomes

Personality based on:
* Heredity is the most dominant factor
* Environmental factors do have some influence
* Aging influences levels of ability

# Culture

#### Reference this http://web.b.ebscohost.com/bsi/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=d4510544-93ea-484a-8ef0-7465960f64c1%40pdc-v-sessmgr03 as (Kim & Toh 2019)

$$ \underbrace{\text{Antecedents}}_{\text{Evidence of Functionality} \\ \text{Leader's Traits} \\ \text{Leader's Personality}} \longrightarrow \underbrace{\text{Cultures}}_{\text{Characteristics} \\ \text{Strength} } \overbrace{\longrightarrow}^{\text{Socialisation}} \underbrace{\text{Outcomes}}_{\text{Shared Assumptions} \\ \text{Shared Values}} $$

### Origins of Culture

#### 1) Cultural-Transfer Perspective
Leader's Past Experience

#### 2) Leader Perspective
Leader's Personality
Negative effect due to bounded rationality and availability bias

#### 3) Functionality Perspective
Cultures are created because those cultures are beneficial to groups

#### Characteristics
Shared Beliefs
Implicit Control
Artifacts: Empirical Evidence

</br>

## Socialisation

### Prearrival
Information of organisation

### Encounter
Integration with organisation

Language: To communicate assumptions, values
• Symbols: To reinforce values and ideology
• Stories/Myths: Exemplifying norms and heroes
• Ceremonies/rituals: To build cohesion and morale
• Dress/uniform: To reinforce identity
• Technology/Structure/Physical Environment: To
reinforce values and shape communication patterns

### Metamorphosis
Adaptation of thought and behaviour of new leader to new organisation

</br>

## Reverse Causality
Idea that people select cultures
* Person-Organisation Fit
* Attraction-Selection-Attrition Theory

</br><hr>

# Perception
Perception is a process by which individuals interpret and organize their sensory impressions to give meaning to their environment.

**Bounded Rationality Theory**
Cognitive capacity is limited
Limited availability of information
Cognitive biases

</br><hr>

# Motivation

$$ \text{Performance} = f(\text{Ability}, \text{Motivation}) $$

$$ \text{Motivation} = f(\underbrace{\text{Effort}}_{\text{Velocity}}, \ \underbrace{\text{Persistence}}_{\text{Duration}}, \underbrace{\text{Goal}}_{\text{Distance Required}}) $$

</br>

## Content-Based Theories
Method of profiling or analysing individuals’ needs that motivate their behavior 

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

**Pyramid**
* Self-actualization: acheiving full-potential
* Esteem needs: self-respect, recognition
* Social needs: needs for having social relationships with others
* Safety needs: security and protection from physical, emotional harms
* Physiological needs: hunger, thirst, shelter, other bodily needs

(+) Intuitive </br>
(-) Not always true </br>

### McClelland’s Theory of Needs

Maslow's Theory (with first three labelle as **Achievement**, **Power**, **Affiliation**) but no heirarchy

</br>

##### Alternative: ERG Theory - Existence - Relatedness - Growth &emsp; (Dual Cycle)


</br>

## Process-Based Theories
Cognitive processes influencing motivation

### Expectancy theory

$$ \text{Motivation} = f(\text{Expectancy}, \text{Instrumentality}, \text{Valence}) $$

**Expectancy** - Effort to Performance Conversion - (Ability, Definition, Trust)

**Instrumentality** - Performance to Reward Conversion - (Trust, Understanding, Fair Allocation)

**Valence** - Reward to Goals Conversion


(-) Performance not always measurable </br>
(-) Model success dependent on valence </br>


</br>

##### Alternative: Equity theory
</br>

## Contemporary Theories

### Self-Determination theory

**Intrinsic** > **Extrinsic** Motivation

* People prefer to have self-determination therefore being more likely to enjoy their jobs (intrinsic motivation)
* Intrinsic motivation has stronger effects on performance

* Monetary incentives undermine the sense of self-determination as you feel that the cause of your actions come from external sources 
* Monetary incentives lower your sense of self-determination, therefore your intrinsic motivation, and thereby your performance.

</br>

##### Alternative: Goal-Setting theory
