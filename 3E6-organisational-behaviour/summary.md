# Personality

**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** 

* Invalid categorization of personality types - Marginal Examples
* Not based on scientific findings
* MBTI does not predict organisational outcomes

**5 Five Factor Model (FFM)**

* Does not force personality into certain categories
* Based on scientific findings
* Significantly predicting organizational outcomes

Personality based on:
* Heredity is the most dominant factor
* Environmental factors do have some influence
* Aging influences levels of ability
