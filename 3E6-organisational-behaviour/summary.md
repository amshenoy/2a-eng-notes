# Personality

**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** 

* Invalid categorization of personality types - Marginal Examples
* Not based on scientific findings
* MBTI does not predict organisational outcomes

**5 Five Factor Model (FFM)**
OCEAN for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neurototicism (Emotional Stability)

* Does not force personality into certain categories
* Based on scientific findings
* Significantly predicting organizational outcomes

Personality based on:
* Heredity is the most dominant factor
* Environmental factors do have some influence
* Aging influences levels of ability

### Origins of Culture

#### 1) Cultural-Transfer Perspective
Leader's Past Experience

#### 2) Leader Perspective
Leader's Personality
Negative effect due to bounded rationality and availability bias

#### 3) Functionality Perspective
Cultures are created because those cultures are beneficial to groups

#### Characteristics
Shared Beliefs
Implicit Control
Artifacts: Empirical Evidence

### Encounter
Integration with organisation

Language: To communicate assumptions, values

# Motivation

$$ \text{Performance} = f(\text{Ability}, \text{Motivation}) $$

$$ \text{Motivation} = f(\underbrace{\text{Effort}}_{\text{Velocity}/\text{Expectancy}}, \underbrace{\text{Persistence}/\text{Instrumentality}}_{\text{Duration}/\text{Valence}}, \underbrace{\text{Goal}}_{Distance Required}) $$

</br>

(+) Intuitive

Maslow's Theory (with first three labelle as **Achievement**, **Power**, **Affiliation**) but no heirarchy


### ERG Theory
Existence - Relatedness - Growth &emsp; (Dual Cycle)

</br>

## Process-Based Theories
Cognitive processes influencing motivation

### Expectancy theory

### Equity theory

</br>

## Contemporary Theories
