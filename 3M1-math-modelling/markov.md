# Markov Chains

## Discrete (Finite) State-Space



## Continuous State-Space

$$ Q = R - E $$
R is the transition rate matrix.
E is the exit rate for each node and hence a diagonal matrix.
Q is the transition generator matrix where rows sum to 0.

The transition function can be expressed as a matrix exponential function:
$$ P(t) = e^{Q t}$$
